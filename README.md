# Graduate-Admission-Data-Science-Project.
The aim is to explore the data visualization and Regression algorithms.

    
There are several factors that determine university applications.
An open data from kaggle provides an opportunity for data science nubbies to try and predict the chance of admission for students. 
This data is based on an Indian perspective, and to learn more about the data here's the link; https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions

I aim to cover three things with the data:
      a. Data Visualization, to understand the data.
      b. Regressions Algorithms: Linear, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
         And determine by use of r2 score the appropriate algorithm for the data.
      c. Predition of values by the appropriate algorithm
